## Lab Rules - Cholesterol
### For a cholesterol test, there are 3 ranges that equal different readings. If the cholesterol level is in the range of 200 to 239, that means someone is "At Risk". If it the range is greater than 340 than that means that someone crossed the threshold into the "Dangerous Territory". If the range is less than 200 than that means that someone is "Heart Healthy"

### The rule I implemented is that if the range is from 200 - 239 then somone is "At Risk". If the range is less than 200 then somone is "Heart Healthy". If the range is less than 200 then someone is "Heart Healthy"
